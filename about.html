<p>Hi there! I'm Ann. Or Annie. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/"target="blank">Bryn Mawr College</a> with a major in Computer Science. There, I was a <a href="http://www.possefoundation.org/"target="blank">Posse Foundation</a> STEM Scholar.</p>

<p>In October, I will begin working at <a href="http://www.pwc.com/"target="blank">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> in Boston as a Technology Consultant with Consumer Markets. Prior to that, in Summer 2018, I completed an internship at <a href="http://www.hc.com/"target="blank"> HarperCollins Publishers</a> in New York, where I built websites, made social media content using Adobe Creative Suite, and exploited my love for books. I love human-centered design and the ways in which technology can enable it.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, you can find me in the kitchen (trying to not set anything on fire), immersed in a book, or taking a walk.</p>
