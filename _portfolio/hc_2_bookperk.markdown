# overview
<br/> If books are the heart of publishing, marketing is the blood. Marketing circulates books into the hands of buyers, distributers, and other channels. 

Marketing has a lot of pieces, and one that I worked with was building promotional web tools. Microsites, which are more simplistic and easy to navigate than a general website, are used to highlight giveaways or target specific buyer audiences. Newsletters will regularly communicate with the buyer, so it is important they are uncluttered and focused. <br/>

# design analysis 
<br/> Bookperk is a promotional e-book newsletter that shares e-book deals, handpicked recommendations, and updates from HarperCollins authors. The [earlier Bookperk site](http://www.bookperk.com/) has cropped graphics, an intense color palette, and and a background booksplash that feels vaguely outdated. The Bookperk team wanted something that clarified what the company was and directed the users to a call-to-action.

# mockup journal 
<br/> Unfortunately, the tight timeline limited design exploration. However, the team was very happy with the two similar options. From here, I would build two prototypes: one more classic and literary, and one more clean and simple. 

<div class="imag_row">
	<img class="col one-alt" src="../../img/bookperk/1-timeless.jpg" alt="" />
	<img class="col one-alt" src="../../img/bookperk/2-modern.jpg" object-fit = "fill" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
The Bookperk team requested two options. On the left, this design would incorporate classic elements and shapes with a clean modern backdrop. The option on the right contains less text, and would have more visual cues. 
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

# prototype and release
<br/> As a final step, to demonstrate what the site and newsletter may look like, I stylized both options.

<div class="imag_row">
	<img class="col three" src="../../img/bookperk/booksplash.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
I redesigned the booksplash to bring some freshness to the page. The staggered covers are more dynamic and the larger jackets display the diversity of books available through Bookperk. </div>


<div class="imag_row">
	<img class="col one-alt" src="../../img/bookperk/landingpage-classic.jpg" alt="" />
	<img class="col one-alt" src="../../img/bookperk/landingpage-modern.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
On the left, the landing page with a classic, more literary approach. On the right, the modern, simple option. </div>

This was my last internship project with HarperCollins Publishers, so I did not to get to see this project through. However, the BookPerk team will choose between these designs for their rebranding.
