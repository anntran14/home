# overview
<br/> If books are the heart of publishing, marketing is the blood. Marketing circulates books into the hands of buyers, distributers, and other channels. 

Marketing has a lot of pieces, and one that I worked with was building promotional web tools. Microsites, which are more simplistic and easy to navigate than a general website, are used to highlight giveaways or target specific buyer audiences. <br/>

# design analysis 
<br/> KissCon is a weekend-long romance event hosted by Avon and Harlequin, two romance novel imprints of HarperCollins Publishers. This annual conference features over 20 bestselling HarperCollins authors and hosts social gatherings for love-hungry fans. So, the website should have glamour, cheekiness, and a lot of sparkle! 


The [earlier KissCon site](https://info.harpercollins.com/avonkisscon/) is dense with text and is visually inconsistent in color and centering.

<div class="img_row_2">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kisscon/kisscon-old1.jpg" alt="" />
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kisscon/kisscon-old2.jpg" object-fit = "fill" alt="" />
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kisscon/kisscon-old3.jpg" alt="" /> 
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	On the left, a description of the event and ticket costs. Middle, a description of the event and its corporate sponsors with an author carousel. Right, a list of featured authors with an author carousel.
</div>


From a design perspective, the usability and modernity of the site could be improved.<br/>

# mockup journal 
<br/> I built two wireframe options for the client. From the wireframe that they chose, I built any linked microsites. 

<center>
<div data-configid="34397066/64145709" style="width:600px; height:388px; align: center" class="issuuembed"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script> </center>
<div class="col three caption">
	This was the final wireframe that the Avon team chose. Based on this, I fleshed out the site. 
</div>

<br/>

# prototype and release
<br/> As a final step, to demonstrate that the mockup was possible to implement, I developed a stylized version of the wireframe for the final website.


<center>
<div data-configid="34397066/64565690" style="width:600px; height:388px;" class="issuuembed"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script></center>
<div class="col three caption">
	Here is the final prototype of the website. 
</div>

Once our team got clearance for the prototype, we built the webiste using Beaver Builder, a software in Wordpress. You can view the [updated KissCon site here](https://info.harpercollins.com/kisscon/).
