# overview
<br/> During Spring 2018, I took an academic course with by Professor [Hee Sook Kim](https://www.heesookkim.com/) at Haverford College called *Computers and Printmaking*. This was an intermediate course that integrated computer software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator with traditional polyester-lithographic printmaking techniques.

 So, how does one do this, exactly?! Blending both mediums can be a labored and careful process. Instead of carving images directly on stones or plates, students design images using computer softwares. We then print the image on polyester plates using a digital printer. Next, we ink the surface of the printmaking plates using rollers. Finally, we print by pressing the plate through a conventional printmaking press. The number of colors for a print mainly varies on the number of plates used, albeit the artist can choose to blend multiple colors on a single plate.

The idea is for students to juxtapose a high-tech method to create images with a low-tech method to print them, as printmaking has existed since the 1400s.
