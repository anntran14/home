# overview
<br/> Throughout Fall 2018, I worked with Ho-Sik Group, a Boston-based firm that hosts unique social experiences through arts, food, entertainment to create designs for two of their start-ups: [Boston Night Market](https://www.nightmarketboston.com/), one of the largest food festivals in Boston inspired by the traditional food markets of Asia, and Potato Potáto, a spiralized fried potato food vendor.

# boston night market
<br/> Based on the website design, past logo, and style choices of the last Market, the current theme was mostly dark with white modern lines and warm, luminous yellow light. Since this event is during the night-time with a mostly young crowd, I wanted all logo creations reflect modern styles with some form of glow.

<div class="col three caption">
	<i>Redesign</i>. A modernization of the last logo to maintain core branding. The moon crest is a visual representation of the evening duration of the event. “Boston” with a contrasted background is a “flag” like those in the previous logo. Its chosen font is vaguely similar to the “Boston Strong” text, which builds the viewer’s city pride and connection. It also makes the Market distinctly from this city. Con: Vaguely plain.

	<img class="col three" style="height:320px;" src="../../img/hosik/neon.JPG" alt="" />
</div></center>
<div class="col three caption">
	<i>Neon</i>. A cool and stylish option to communicate a fun night out. “Boston” is in a classic serif font that reflects the proper, traditional values of the city. The letters sit closely together to make the logo compact and contrast with the sprawling script font on top. The outlined script font shares the outlined element of “Boston” but contrasts with a loose, thick, playful scrawl. Con: May be visually busy from varying line thicknesses and neon font treatment in the script font. 
</div>

<center><div class="img_row_5">
	<img class="col three" style="height:320px;" src="../../img/hosik/lantern.JPG" alt="" />
</div></center>
<div class="col three caption">
	<i>Lantern</i>. Graphic image logo interpretation. Communicates the Asian inspiration of the night market. The drawn lantern lines and “Boston” script font compliment the clean, professional circle and “NIGHT MARKET” sans serif text. The red background option and yellow highlight option are included to show the design’s versatility.  With the yellow highlight, it looks only slightly reminiscent of an Asian theme. Would work well as a sticker/badge. Con: Being mostly hand-drawn, the logo may feel less professional.

# potato potáto
This start-up will be selling spiralized fried potatoes, a common street food, in the Greater Boston area. Ho-Sik Group was looking for a playful logo and a mascot to match.
